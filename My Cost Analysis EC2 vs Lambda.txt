My Cost Analysis: EC2 vs Lambda

EC2 Cost:
Instance 
type: t2.nano
Pricing on-demand, us-east-1 roughly $0.0058/hour
The usage is 730 hours per month
tenancy is shared by default

Cost:
t2.nano is roughly $0.0058/hour
And Monthly is equal to 0.0058 × 730 = $4.23

Lambda cost:
request charge is equal to $0.20 / 1,000,000
= $0.00000020
The compute charge is:
128 mb = 0.125 GB
0.125 x 0.1 x 0.0000166667
= $0.000000208
The total per request is roughly: $0.000000408

If we were to divide the cost of the EC2 cost by the Lambda cost per request, we would divide 4.23 / 0.000000408 which would then give us roughly 10,360,000 requests per month

Conclusion:
A t2.nano EC2 instance that is running continually costs about $4.23 per month and the AWS lambda function (128 mb memory, approx. 100 ms execution time) costs approximately $0.00000408 per request, which includes the requests and compute charges.
And at approx 10 mill requests per month, the lamba's total costs is equal to that of the monthly EC2 cost. Now belove this usage level, the lambda is more cost effect due to its pay per request pricing model. Now if we go above this, the EC2 becomes the cheaper option because of its fixed monthly cost pricing.

Finally, due to the fact that I could not have access to the proper AWS pricing calculator, I had to use the public version which did not require a login. However the issue for my math and screenshot not being accurate lies in the fact that I could not find the proper options as they were not available (ie. t2.nano). Please put this into consideration when grading my work
